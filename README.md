# JFortschritt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanbirkner/jfortschritt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanbirkner/jfortschritt)

JFortschritt is a small library for writing progress bars to the command-line.

JFortschritt is published under the
[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). It needs Java 7,
because this is the version that is supported by most applications that I
encounter. Please let me know if you need JFortschritt to support an older
version of Java.


## Installation

JFortschritt is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.stefanbirkner</groupId>
      <artifactId>jfortschritt</artifactId>
      <version>0.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>


## Usage

Currently the library provides a single class: the
`ProgressLine`. First create a new progress line.

    import com.github.stefanbirkner.jfortschritt.*;

    ...

    ProgressLine progressLine = new ProgressLine();

Start the progress line with the number of steps that are needed for
completion:

    progressLine.startWithNumberOfSteps(42);

It immediately prints an empty progress bar and a counter:

    [>                                                                     ]

The width of the line is always 72 chars. Now move the progress line forward.

    progressLine.moveForward();

and see the result

    [==>                                                                   ]

This is how a progress line looks at the end. (It renders a new line
character, too. Thus additional text starts at a new line.)

    [=====================================================================>]

You may add additional parts to the progress line. E.g. JFortschritt provides
a counter, but you can build your own parts by implementing the interface
`ProgressLinePart`.

    ProgressLine progressLine = new ProgressLine(new Counter());

This is how a progress line looks with the additional parts.

    [==>                                                            ] (1/42)
